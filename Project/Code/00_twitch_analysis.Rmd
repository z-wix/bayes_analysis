I am going to try and look at just broad Twitch streamer data to build a model off of it. I have identified a dataset from Kaggle that gives me lots of variables that I could help me model on minutes streamed. 

There is also a Twitch API that might be better cause I would like more variables to look at such as the main game they stream, etc. But for now I am looking at just the stats.

```{r}
# Packages
library(tidyverse)

# Load Data
twitch <- read_csv(here::here("Project/Data", "twitchdata-update.csv"))

```
