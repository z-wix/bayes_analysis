## Project Organization

`01_smash_data.Rmd` goes through my data collection process which includes webscrapping tables, cleaning data, and combining datasets to make a single source to model on as well as formulating the data story. Also includes some failed attempts at gathering data before moving to different source.

`02_smash_modeling.Rmd` The beginning of my modeling process, mostly creating DAG's and simple linear models.

`03_smash_mcmc.Rmd` Moving onto MCMC modeling and more complex models.

`04_smash_iterations.Rmd` More Iterations on Project with different models.

`01_fortnite_data.Rmd` First attempt at project to use an API to extract data on fortnite players. However, my data source ended up not having enough data to do a proper analysis.

`01_twitch_analysis.Rmd` using data from Twitch dataset from Kaggle. Data import and cleaning.

`02_twitch_analysis.Rmd` start of modeling. DAG and simple linear models.

## Project Workflow

1. Data Story

- Begin with a conceptual story: Where do these data come from? What does the theory say?

- Translate into probability statements (i.e., the likelihood or observational model).

- The resulting model is generative.

2. Bayesian Updating

- Bayesian updating is learning! (See illustration.)

- Every posterior is the prior for the next observation.

- Natural consequence of probability.
The sample size is automatically embodied in the posterior (i.e., no “degrees of freedom”).

3. Evaluate

- Inference is conditioned on the chosen model.

- Use prior predictive checks and posterior predictive checks to evaluate the model.

- Modeling is iterative. You’ll likely need to revise your story.

### Pushed to GitHub

* `/Code` Each script should do something specific (like tidyverse functions), have a descriptive name, and include number prefixes if they are meant to be run in a certain order (e.g., `01_import_data.R`, `02_clean_data.R`).
* `/Data` While all data live here, only data that are small and can be shared publicly will be pushed.
* `/Figures` Figures live here, including images (saved as PNG files) and data referenced or used for tables, for use in the `README` and report.
* `/Report` The report, without any PDF knits.
* `README` This page, with any other organization details to make it easy to navigate your repository.

### Not Pushed to GitHub

* `/Output` Output from model runs. These files tend to be too large. They are also something each user can create on their own.
