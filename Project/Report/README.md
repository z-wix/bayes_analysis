Figuring Things Out

## Project Overview

I am still deciding on what I want to do. I have a few ideas of what
would be really interesting to do but not sure what type of analysis to
do. Partially one of the reasons I am leaning towards one of these types
of projects is because it would be a dream to work for a company in
these industries so creating a project on relevant data would be
beneficial for me as I stand out in applications and can share this. So
here are some of my ideas…

#### *Ideas*

  - **eSports/Videogame data**
      - Either with Super Smash Bros or Fornite looking at stats of
        professional players.
      - I know there is data for Fornite that I have found on Kaggle
        before but mostly it is like players earnings.
      - I would like to use some kind of data from the games themselves,
        like in Super Smash Bors players are always making tier lists
        for the best characters but if I could make a tier list based on
        real data from the game combined with professional player stats
        to decide which characters are actually the best, etc.
      - It would also be really interesting to look at maybe another
        game genre that isn’t competitive like Zelda franchise. Breath
        of the Wild is such a large game there has to be data and some
        kind of analysis that would be interesting.
  - **Music data**
      - I did a project using Spotify data recently and it was super
        interesting and it would be cool to do some kind of analysis
        looking into a specific genre.
      - I love *lo-fi* music and I think it is a very unique space where
        there are a lot of artists but they aren’t really looking to get
        famous, it seems like more of a place for artists to make music
        for themselves.
      - The problem is that I don’t know if I can find the data for
        something like this. You can get Spotify for developers and look
        at your own music playlists but it is very limited, atleast with
        the R packages and APIs available such as `Rspotify`.
      - Python has an API that seems to gather more data such as stats
        like tempo, danceability, etc. that have to do with the music
        themselves.
  - **Other**
      - I am also open to other ideas. I think I need to read around
        these topics to see if there is any gaps in research that I
        could work on.
