### Pushed to GitHub

  - `/Assignments` Each assignment should be included as an R Markdown
    file (e.g., `Assignment-02.Rmd`) knit as a `github_document` to
    produce a Markdown file (e.g., `Assignment-02.md`).
  - `/Notes` Keep your notes as you work through *Statistical
    Rethinking* here. It is recommended to do so as an organized series
    of R Markdown files (e.g., `01_The-Golem-of-Prague.Rmd`).
  - `/Project` Keep everything related to the project here (see the
    [project organization
    details](https://github.com/quant-seminar/repo-template/tree/main/Project)).
  - `README` This page, with any other organization details to make it
    easy to navigate your repository.

### Not Pushed to GitHub

  - `/Private` PDFs that you want to keep track of reading locally and
    other files you want to keep with your repository.
