## Main focuses

- Having informed priors is super important

- Use DAGs for seeing hidden effects skewing models

## Modeling discrete events

> Discrete, regular behavior in nature is not the product of discrete regular systems. It's the product of some continuous dynamical underlying system.

Fireflies, asteriod belts

- tend to spark synchoronously because they see others lighting up and mirror it. It is a discrete distribution

Marketing example: Choice models (choice == discrete) 

First set of GLMs we consider

## Binomial Regression

Max Entropy : 
- MECE, constant expected value

Logistic regression:
- single trial

Aggregated binomial regression:
- Multiple trials are combined
