## Entropy

Helps us solve problems when choosing distribution when conventional choices are not the best choices.

- Choosing a distribution with the largest entropy means spreading probability as evenly as possible while staying consistent with our knowledge.

Nature tends to produce distributions with high entropy.

Works even if we don't fully understand why.

### Maximum Entropy

> The distribution that can happen the most ways is also the distribution with the biggest information entropy. The distribution with the biggest entropy is the most conservative distribution that obeys its constraints.

### Binomial Distribution

When only two unordered outcomes are possible and the numbers of each type of outcome is expected to be constant. then binomial is has the highest entropy.

No guarantee that this is best distribution for the real problem but is most conservative.

**Not about the data, it is about the model**
