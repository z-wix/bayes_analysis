## Chapter 8 - Conditional Manatees

Off the shelf vs. Bespoke

- We provide tools and golems which are useful but also counterproductive

"Seek first to understand, then to be understood"


## Interactions

All about conditionality, how predictors can be conditional on other predictors.

- Very few instances of independent predictors(?)

- Conditioning happens throughout the statistical inference process
  + sampling, posterior distribution, inferences, etc.
  
  
Identifying interactions is one thing, modeling them is another.

Interaction examples:

- Commercial success of a movie?
- Admission into grad school?
